# Django File Encryptor

## Overview

The Django File Encryptor is a web application that allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files using RSA and AES encryption algorithms. Users can generate RSA key pairs, encrypt files with a public key, and decrypt files with a private key.

## Features

- **RSA Key Generation**: Generate RSA public and private key pairs.
- **File Encryption**: Encrypt files using a combination of RSA and AES encryption.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt files using the corresponding RSA private key.
- **File Download**: Download encrypted and decrypted files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Django 3.2+
- cryptography library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sarthakghere/File-Encryptor.git
